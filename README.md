## Bot Battlr - React Web App

This project allows users to manage a virtual army of bots.
The user can view all available bots in the BotCollection component select and add individual bots to their army in the YourBotArmy component, release a bot from their army and permanently delete a bot from both the frontend and backend.


## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. 
The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the Array.
